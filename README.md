# Classifying Brain Signal of Pain
<pre>
Course project of MGE304: Methodologies of Management Engineering, UNIST
</pre>

## Description
* Goal of this project is to split pain and non-pain brain signal of monkey
* Used three different classifiers
* Classification performance is evaluted by Diagnostic Odds Ratio (DOR)

## Classification Results
Classifier | DOR 
------------ | ------------ 
Bayesian Generative Classifier | 13.1461  
SVM w/ RBF kernel | 19.4556
SVM w/ Polynomial kernel | 18.9862
SVM w/ Sigmoid kernel  | 18.4913
MLP | 18.3357
